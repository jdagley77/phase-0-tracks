<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

The person is for clarity, communication, and organization, and for the use of screenreaders and people with disabilities. The tags can also be useful within CSS, to target specific content accurately.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser will display the head and body first, followed by the elements in the hierarchy in which they appear.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned how to create snippets, or shortcuts. I think I will create more at a later date, ie one that includes some html semantic elements.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The vagueness of the semantic elements was hard to understand because it seems like there are several ways to use elements. I will continue to refer to the site I have found to be helpful, and the flow chart included in the exercise helped. It helps to see examples as well.
