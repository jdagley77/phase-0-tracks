//In algos.js, write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns 
//the longest word or phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of 
//["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase". 
//This is a logical reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based on what you already know, 
//rather than Googling the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. 
//Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
//Add driver code that tests your function on a few arrays.

//create an array of different words
//iterate through the items in the words array
//for each string length in the words array
//if the item's length is greater than the item before it, put it in a new array
//print the last item in the new array



var words = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven"];
var newArray = []


for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {  //iterate through the array of words

};
