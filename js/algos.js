//In algos.js, write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns 
//the longest word or phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of 
//["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase". 
//This is a logical reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based on what you already know, 
//rather than Googling the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. 
//Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
//Add driver code that tests your function on a few arrays.

//create an array of different words
//iterate through the items in the array
//for each item (string) in the array, count the number of letters in each item
//create an empty hash
//for each string in the array, store it as a key in the object
//store each integer as a value in an object
//how can i sort the items of the hash by their values?
//return the last value in the hash


var words = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven"];

var wordObj = {}

for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {  //iterate through the array of words
	i.length

};
