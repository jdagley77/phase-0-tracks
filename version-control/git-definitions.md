# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the ability to create save points of new features throughout a project, so that each new feature can be tested before adding to the master.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is an extension of the master file. You would use a branch to create and test a new feature before adding those changes to the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit records files that are "staged" to your local repository. A good commit message should be clear and descriptive of the updates you have made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when 2 users are working on the same branch, on the same line, and commit differences in their code.
