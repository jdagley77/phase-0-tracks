DEBRIEF:
All of the techniques helped a lot. Especially doing some initially research, taking a step back and asking a few questions to direct my research. The questions overlapped a bit but it helped to categorize concepts and then see how they are related as I researched.

A method I forgot about was the power of videos instead of just using the docs. I got bored of researching through several sites and mixing up the research with videos was really effective. I should take advantage of the many good videos out there.
